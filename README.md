# Social Network API
## Description
This is an API developed for a social network web application that allows users to share their thoughts, react to their friends' thoughts, and create a list of friends. It utilizes Express.js for routing, MongoDB for the database, Mongoose ODM, and day.js for timestamp formatting. The seed data is generated using Insomnia.
